# Bosch-Hackathon-Solution
The following repository is my solution for the Bosch hackathon.I was even called for the final phase of the hackathon in the Robert Bosch's Bangalore office though I could not attend the final hackathon phase due to been out of India that point of time.A text file data.txt was given containing the commentary of one innings of a cricket match where I have to generate the score card as given in Scorecard_Format.png.The output file I generated is scorecard.txt and the screenshot of the scorecard generated is the Scorecard.png file.
